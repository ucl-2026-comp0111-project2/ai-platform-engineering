/**
 * POST /api/skills/configs/[id]/clone
 *
 * Escape hatch for the built-in mutation lock. Produces an editable
 * user-owned copy of any visible skill (built-in, custom, or hub
 * cached) without granting write access to the original.
 *
 * The clone:
 *   * Gets a brand-new id (``skill-<slug>-<random>``).
 *   * Sets ``is_system: false`` so the user can edit it freely.
 *   * Re-attributes ``owner_id`` to the caller.
 *   * Defaults visibility to ``private`` (callers can publish later).
 *   * Copies SKILL.md content + ancillary files verbatim.
 *   * Re-runs the scanner on the copy so the new row gets its own
 *     scan_status (the source row's status doesn't transfer — the
 *     copy is logically a new artifact and policy must re-evaluate).
 *
 * Permissions: any user who can read the source (per
 * ``getAgentSkillVisibleToUser``) can clone it. The built-in lock
 * deliberately does **not** apply here — the whole point of clone
 * is to produce an unlocked copy.
