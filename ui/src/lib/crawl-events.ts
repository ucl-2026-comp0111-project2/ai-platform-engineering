/**
 * Crawl event taxonomy for the live "Crawl Console" admin feature.
 *
 * The hub crawlers (`crawlGitHubRepo`, `crawlGitLabRepo`) accept an
 * optional ``CrawlEventEmitter`` that lets callers observe each
 * outbound HTTP request and each SKILL.md discovered while the
 * crawl is in flight. The two streaming routes
 * (``POST /api/skill-hubs/crawl`` and
 * ``POST /api/skill-hubs/[id]/refresh``) wrap an emitter around an
 * NDJSON `ReadableStream` so the admin UI can render a live console.
 *
 * # Why a separate module
 *
 * The events are deliberately decoupled from the wire format. This
 * file defines the *shape* of events and a no-op base emitter. The
 * NDJSON encoder, redaction utilities, and size caps live in
 * ``crawl-stream.ts`` (see commit #2 of the streaming feature).
 * Tests can substitute a buffering emitter (``BufferingCrawlEmitter``
 * below) without touching any HTTP plumbing.
 *
 * # Backward compatibility
 *
 * The ``emitter`` parameter is optional everywhere. When omitted,
 * the crawl helpers behave exactly as before — no extra allocations,
 * no extra requests, no behavior change. This file is the foundation
 * commit of the streaming feature; subsequent commits add the wire
 * encoder, the API streaming branch, and the UI.
