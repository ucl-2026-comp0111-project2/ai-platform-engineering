/**
 * Per-type FGA enforcement manifest (spec 2026-06-04-fga-coverage-guarantee,
 * Layer 2).
 *
 * This is the single artifact an auditor reads to answer "is resource type X
 * gated, and where?". Every type in `UNIVERSAL_REBAC_RESOURCE_TYPES` MUST have an
 * entry here; the `fga-enforcement-manifest.test.ts` guard fails CI on any missing
 * or `not_gated`-without-allowlist type, and asserts that `rebac_enforced` surfaces
 * point at files that actually exist.
 *
 * Status meanings:
 *   - rebac_enforced : an OpenFGA check gates runtime access on this type.
 *   - role_gated     : gated by Keycloak / coarse roles (FGA tuples may be written
 *                      but are not the runtime gate yet).
 *   - rebac_shadowed : FGA tuples are written/evaluated in shadow, not yet the gate.
 *   - not_gated      : intentionally ungated — only allowed via NOT_GATED_ALLOWLIST.
 *
 * `surfaces` are repo-relative paths to the authoritative enforcement / reconcile
 * code for the type. For `rebac_enforced` types the guard requires each path to
 * exist on disk (so a refactor that moves the gate updates the manifest).
