/**
 * Tests for `buildIngestionSourceRelationshipTupleDiff` (spec
 * 2026-07-21-rag-source-config-db, US5's `visibility: "global"` grant).
 *
 * `Check(user:*, can_read, ingestion_source:X)` is satisfied by the
 * `user:* reader` tuple this builder writes when `globalUserAccess` is
 * true — OpenFGA itself isn't exercised here (no server in unit tests),
 * so this asserts the tuple diff the reconcile layer feeds it.
