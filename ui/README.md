# CAIPE UI

Next.js BFF and web UI for CAIPE. The UI talks to Dynamic Agents through
server-side API routes, manages MongoDB-backed chat state, and exposes admin
surfaces for models, MCP servers, skills, credentials, RBAC, audit logs, and
platform health.

## Quick Start

From the repository root:

```bash
make caipe-ui-dev
```

Or run directly:

```bash
cd ui
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

## Runtime Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `DYNAMIC_AGENTS_URL` | `http://localhost:8100` in local dev, `http://dynamic-agents:8100` in production | Server-side Dynamic Agents runtime URL |
| `MONGODB_URI` | unset | Enables MongoDB-backed conversations and admin state |
| `PROMETHEUS_URL` | unset | Server-side Prometheus-compatible query URL for Admin metrics and health. In HA deployments, use a deduplicating query frontend such as Thanos rather than a load-balanced service over independent Prometheus replicas. |
| `RAG_SERVER_URL` | unset | Server-side RAG API URL |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | unset | Required for authenticated deployments |
| `SSO_ENABLED` | `false` | Enables OIDC-backed auth |

Browser chat traffic goes through the BFF routes under
`/api/v1/chat/stream/*`; the browser does not call the Dynamic Agents service
directly.

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

For Docker Compose:

```bash
COMPOSE_PROFILES=caipe-ui,dynamic-agents,caipe-mongodb docker compose -f ../docker-compose.dev.yaml up --build
```

```

## Current Chat Flow

1. The user selects or opens a conversation in the UI.
2. The BFF validates auth/RBAC and forwards stream requests to Dynamic Agents.
3. Dynamic Agents streams AG-UI/SSE events back through the BFF.
4. The UI stores conversation messages and stream events in MongoDB-backed state.
5. MCP tools are reached through configured MCP server rows, usually via AgentGateway.
