    file. Images become ``image`` blocks and documents (PDF, CSV, Office, HTML,

      ``max_file_bytes`` (per file), or ``max_turn_bytes`` (aggregate of the

    ``capabilities=None`` means "accept everything the provider supports"

    When ``store`` is provided, a surviving file's bytes are uploaded to the
