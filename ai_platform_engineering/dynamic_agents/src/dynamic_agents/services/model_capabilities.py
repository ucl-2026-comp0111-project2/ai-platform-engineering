"""Per-model input-capability declarations.

Different LLMs accept different input modalities: most current Claude models on
Bedrock read images *and* documents, while some smaller/older models are
text-only ("no-vision"). The runtime needs to know, per model, what a file can
be sent as — otherwise a no-vision model is handed image blocks it cannot
process and errors at the provider instead of degrading cleanly.

This module is the single source of truth for that. Capabilities are a property
of the *model*, not the agent, so many agents sharing one model id all inherit
the same declaration automatically.

Resolution order for ``get_model_capabilities(model_id)``:

1. Exact match in the merged registry.
2. Longest matching *prefix* (so ``global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-5-…-v1:0``
   resolves via the ``global.anthropic.claude-`` family entry).
3. A permissive default (**accepts everything**) for anything undeclared, so a
   model we simply haven't catalogued behaves exactly as it does today —
   degradation only ever fires for a model *explicitly* declared limited.

The registry is seeded with the deployed defaults below and can be extended or
overridden at deploy time via the ``MODEL_CAPABILITIES_JSON`` env var (see
``config.Settings.model_capabilities_json``) — this is the values-driven seam a
follow-up ticket uses to declare per-model acceptance from Helm values without a
code change.
