    Tracing (Langfuse) Configuration:
        The following environment variables are read by cnoe-agent-utils.TracingManager
        to enable Langfuse tracing for LLM calls and agent execution:

        - ENABLE_TRACING: Set to "true" to enable tracing (default: disabled)
        - LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY: Langfuse project public key (e.g., "pk-lf-xxx")
        - LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY: Langfuse project secret key (e.g., "sk-lf-xxx")
        - LANGFUSE_HOST: Langfuse server URL (e.g., "http://langfuse-web:3000")

        When enabled, traces are grouped by session_id (conversation) and include:
        - LLM inputs/outputs with token counts
        - Tool calls as nested spans
        - Agent metadata (name, config_id, user_id)
