"""Turn Slack file attachments into multimodal chat input.

When a user attaches files to a Slack message, the event carries a ``files``
array where each entry has a **private** download URL (``url_private`` /
``url_private_download``) plus metadata (``mimetype``, ``name``, ``size``).
Slack will only serve those bytes to a request that presents the bot token as
``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` — an unauthenticated fetch returns an HTML
login page, not the file.

This module downloads those bytes and base64-encodes them into the dict shape
the Dynamic Agents backend expects for ``ChatRequest.files`` (see the
``InputFile`` model): ``{"mime_type", "data", "name"}``. The backend's
``_build_user_content`` then maps each MIME type to the correct multimodal
content block (image vs document) and skips types Bedrock cannot ingest — so
this module is deliberately **type-agnostic**: it downloads whatever the user
attached and lets the backend decide what is usable.

The one transform that MUST happen here is url → base64: Bedrock's Converse API
accepts image/document data only as inline base64, never as a URL it fetches
itself. Since Slack's URLs are private (auth-gated) anyway, the model could not
reach them even if Bedrock allowed URLs.
