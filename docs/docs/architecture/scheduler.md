The scheduler runs Dynamic Agent chats on recurring cron schedules or as delayed
one-off jobs. It is disabled by default. Enabling it installs:

- `caipe-scheduler`, which stores schedules in MongoDB and manages Kubernetes
  CronJobs and Jobs.
- `mcp-scheduler`, which exposes schedule operations to Dynamic Agents.
- `caipe-cron-runner`, the short-lived container started by each CronJob or Job.
- CAIPE UI/BFF wiring that turns a scheduled fire into a chat owned by the user
  who created the schedule.

Dynamic Agents, the CAIPE UI, Keycloak, AgentGateway, and MongoDB are required.
OpenFGA is optional for the scheduler itself, but is required for the admin-only
policy described below.

The umbrella chart ships with the feature off:

```yaml
global:
  scheduler:
    enabled: false
```

## Identity and token flow

Schedule creation and scheduled execution use different credentials.

### Create or manage a schedule

The live user's Keycloak JWT determines schedule ownership. Dynamic Agents
resolves the scheduler MCP's `caller_token` credential source and places that
JWT in `X-CAIPE-Caller-Token`. AgentGateway authenticates and authorizes the
request, then forwards that header to `mcp-scheduler`.

`mcp-scheduler` does not validate or decode the JWT. It relays the opaque value
to `caipe-scheduler` as an `Authorization` bearer. The scheduler validates the
signature, issuer, audience, and expiry, then derives `owner_sub` and
`owner_user_id` from the claims. An agent cannot choose or override the owner.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant U as User
  participant B as CAIPE UI / BFF
  participant D as Dynamic Agents
  participant G as AgentGateway
  participant M as mcp-scheduler
  participant S as caipe-scheduler
  participant K as Keycloak JWKS
  participant DB as MongoDB

  U->>B: Authenticated chat request
  B->>D: Authorization: Bearer user-JWT
  D->>G: Authorization: Bearer user-JWT<br/>X-CAIPE-Caller-Token: user-JWT
  G->>M: X-CAIPE-Caller-Token: user-JWT
  M->>S: Authorization: Bearer user-JWT<br/>X-Scheduler-Token: shared-service-token
  S->>K: Fetch or use cached signing keys
  K-->>S: JWKS
  S->>S: Validate JWT and derive owner
  S->>DB: Store owner_sub and owner_user_id
  S-->>M: Schedule result
  M-->>G: MCP tool result
  G-->>D: MCP tool result
  D-->>B: Agent response
  B-->>U: Agent response
```

`schedulerMcp.auth.mode` intentionally remains `none`. AgentGateway is the MCP
authentication boundary, while `caipe-scheduler` is the ownership boundary and
validates the forwarded JWT itself.

### Execute a scheduled run

Cron runner pods do not hold a user JWT. They authenticate to the BFF only with
the shared `X-Scheduler-Token`. The BFF ignores any caller-supplied owner or
agent identity, loads both from the authoritative MongoDB schedule record, and
uses the dedicated `caipe-scheduler-runner` Keycloak client to mint a short-lived
JWT for the stored owner.

The BFF checks that the owner can still use the selected agent and forwards the
minted owner JWT to Dynamic Agents. All later AgentGateway and MCP calls therefore
run with the schedule owner's current permissions. A disabled owner, removed
agent grant, failed token exchange, or missing schedule record fails closed.

```mermaid

  participant R as caipe-cron-runner
  participant S as caipe-scheduler
  participant B as CAIPE UI / BFF

  participant G as AgentGateway

  C->>R: Start runner with schedule_id

  K-->>B: Short-lived owner JWT
  B->>B: Check owner can use agent
  B->>D: Authorization: Bearer owner-JWT
  D->>G: Tool calls as schedule owner
```

The shared scheduler token proves only that the request came from the scheduler
subsystem. It is never accepted as user identity. Use the same Kubernetes Secret
for the scheduler, scheduler MCP, cron runner, and BFF, and do not place its
literal value in a values file.

## Enable the scheduler

The following example uses a Helm release named `caipe` in namespace `caipe`
with the bundled Keycloak. Replace the public issuer and MongoDB Secret values
for your environment. The internal JWKS URL may remain cluster-local, but the
issuer must exactly match the `iss` claim in user tokens.

```yaml
tags:
  caipe-ui: true
  dynamic-agents: true
  keycloak: true

global:
  scheduler:
    enabled: true
    serviceTokenSecretName: caipe-scheduler-service-token
    serviceTokenSecretKey: token
  agentgateway:
    enabled: true
    static:
      jwtAuth:
        enabled: true
        issuer: https://id.example.com/realms/caipe
        jwksUrl: http://caipe-keycloak:8080/realms/caipe/protocol/openid-connect/certs
        audiences:
          - caipe-platform
          - agentgateway

scheduler:
  mongo:
    # Use the same MongoDB as the CAIPE UI.
    existingSecret: caipe-caipe-ui-secret
    existingSecretKey: MONGODB_URI
    database: caipe
  auth:
    jwksUrl: http://caipe-keycloak:8080/realms/caipe/protocol/openid-connect/certs
    issuer: https://id.example.com/realms/caipe
    audiences:
      - caipe-platform

schedulerMcp:
  enabled: true
  auth:
    mode: none

keycloak:
  features:
    tokenExchange: true
    adminFineGrainedAuthz: true
  schedulerTokenExchange:
    enabled: true
    botClientId: caipe-scheduler-runner

caipe-ui:
  schedulerRunnerClient:
    clientId: caipe-scheduler-runner
  appConfig:
    mcp_servers:
      - id: scheduler
        name: Scheduler
        description: Cron-style scheduled Dynamic Agent chat runs.
        transport: http
        endpoint: http://caipe-agentgateway:4000/mcp/scheduler
        enabled: true
        credential_sources:
          - kind: caller_token
            target: header
            name: X-CAIPE-Caller-Token
```

When `scheduler.serviceToken.existingSecret` is empty, the chart creates and
preserves the Secret named by `global.scheduler.serviceTokenSecretName`. For an
operator-managed Secret, set both locations to the same Secret name and key:

```yaml
global:
  scheduler:
    serviceTokenSecretName: my-scheduler-service-token
    serviceTokenSecretKey: token

scheduler:
  serviceToken:
    existingSecret: my-scheduler-service-token
    existingSecretKey: token
```

With the bundled Keycloak, leaving
`keycloak.schedulerTokenExchange.secretRef` and
`caipe-ui.schedulerRunnerClient.secretName` empty makes the chart use its
release-derived scheduler-runner Secret. If the Secret is managed externally,
set both values to the same name. It must contain the key
`KC_SCHEDULER_CLIENT_SECRET`:

```yaml
keycloak:
  schedulerTokenExchange:
    secretRef: my-scheduler-runner-client

caipe-ui:
  schedulerRunnerClient:
    secretName: my-scheduler-runner-client
    secretKey: KC_SCHEDULER_CLIENT_SECRET
```

Finally, grant the scheduler tools only to agents that should be able to create
or manage schedules. For a config-driven agent:

```yaml
caipe-ui:
  appConfig:
    agents:
      - id: scheduled-operations
        name: Scheduled Operations
        enabled: true
        # Add the model and prompt fields required by your deployment.
        allowed_tools:
          scheduler:
            - create_schedule
            - list_schedules
            - get_schedule
            - update_schedule
            - pause_schedule
            - resume_schedule
            - restart_schedule
            - schedule_one_off
            - list_one_off_runs
            - delete_schedule
```

Helm replaces lists rather than merging list entries. If `mcp_servers` or
`agents` already exists in another values file, add the scheduler entries to
that existing list instead of defining a second list in a later values file.

## Configure the scheduler editor agent

The Schedules page includes a **Chat with agent** action for modifying an
existing schedule through an agent. An organization admin can change the
platform-wide editor agent in **Admin → General → Scheduler editor agent**:

1. Select an agent from **Agent for schedule editing**.
2. Save the setting.

The UI sends `schedule_editor_agent_id` to
`PATCH /api/admin/platform-config`. The BFF requires platform-admin and
`system_config:platform_settings` management access, then stores the value in
MongoDB:

```text
collection: platform_config
document:   _id = platform_settings
field:      schedule_editor_agent_id
```

The editor-agent precedence for **Chat with agent** is:

1. The schedule's own `edit_agent_id`, when present.
2. MongoDB `platform_config.schedule_editor_agent_id`.
3. The deployment value `SCHEDULE_EDITOR_AGENT_ID`.
4. Normal chat-agent selection: the user's accessible personal default, the
   accessible platform default, then the first available agent.

A schedule-specific `edit_agent_id` therefore overrides both the admin setting
and the deployment value. The MongoDB admin setting overrides the deployment
value. Clearing the admin setting restores `SCHEDULE_EDITOR_AGENT_ID`; if that
is also unset, normal chat-agent selection applies.

The Admin UI displays when the effective value comes from
`SCHEDULE_EDITOR_AGENT_ID` and explains that saving a different agent creates a
MongoDB override. The platform-config cache is cleared after a successful
update, so the next **Chat with agent** action uses the new value without a pod
restart.

This setting selects an existing agent but does not grant access to it. Users
must already be able to use the selected agent. This differs from the
**Platform default agent** setting: both settings use the same
`platform_config` document and override their deployment fallbacks, but setting
the platform default also reconciles the corresponding global OpenFGA agent
grant.

## Restrict scheduler tools to organization admins

Enable OpenFGA, the AgentGateway authorization bridge, JWT validation, and the
selective scheduler server check:

```yaml
openfga:
  enabled: true

openfgaAuthzBridge:
  enabled: true

global:
  agentgateway:
    enabled: true
    extAuth:
      enabled: true
      # The default service name is <release>-openfga-authz-bridge.
      port: 9100

openfga-authz-bridge:
  openfga:
    httpUrl: http://caipe-openfga:8080
    storeName: caipe-openfga
  tokenValidation:
    jwksUrl: http://caipe-keycloak:8080/realms/caipe/protocol/openid-connect/certs
    issuer: https://id.example.com/realms/caipe
    audiences:
      - caipe-platform
      - agentgateway
  restrictedMcpServers:
    - scheduler # <- This enables the admin-only check for /mcp/scheduler requests.
```

The Schedules tab visibility is directly controlled by
`SCHEDULER_ADMIN_ONLY`. The UI loads it as `config.schedulerAdminOnly` and
renders the tab with this condition:

```text
!config.schedulerAdminOnly || isAdmin
```

Therefore:

- `SCHEDULER_ADMIN_ONLY: "true"` hides the tab from organization members and
  shows it to organization admins.
- `SCHEDULER_ADMIN_ONLY: "false"` shows the tab to both members and admins.

The umbrella chart keeps this UI flag aligned with the AgentGateway policy. Its
`caipe-ui-integration-flags` ConfigMap renders:

```yaml
SCHEDULER_ADMIN_ONLY: "true"
```

when `scheduler` is present in
`openfga-authz-bridge.restrictedMcpServers`; otherwise it renders the flag as
`"false"`. The CAIPE UI reads the flag at process startup. The Schedules tab
also requires both Dynamic Agents and the scheduler to be enabled.

When the flag is `"true"`, the UI determines organization-admin access from
OpenFGA `can_manage organization:<org>`, not from a legacy MongoDB role or the
deprecated OIDC bootstrap-admin configuration.

| `SCHEDULER_ADMIN_ONLY` | Organization member | Organization admin |
|---|---:|---:|
| `"true"` | Tab hidden | Tab visible |
| `"false"` | Tab visible | Tab visible |

Deploying only a new CAIPE UI image is not sufficient for this behavior. The
deployed umbrella chart must include the
`caipe-ui-integration-flags-configmap.yaml` template that derives
`SCHEDULER_ADMIN_ONLY`, and the CAIPE UI pods must be rolled out so the new
ConfigMap value enters their environment.

Tab visibility is a user-experience control, not the authorization boundary.
The OpenFGA bridge check below remains responsible for denying direct
scheduler MCP requests from callers without access.

For every request under `/mcp/scheduler`, the bridge checks:

```text
user:<JWT sub> can_invoke mcp_server:scheduler
```

```mermaid

  R["Request to /mcp/scheduler"] --> G["AgentGateway<br/>validates caller JWT"]

```

The config-driven MCP relationship reconciler gives organization members
`reader` and `user`, but deliberately removes their `invoker` relationship. It
gives `organization:<org>#admin` the `manager` relationship. In the OpenFGA
model, `manager` implies `can_manage`, and `can_manage` implies `can_invoke`.
The resulting default policy is:

| Caller | Discover scheduler MCP | Invoke scheduler MCP |
|---|---:|---:|
| Organization member | Yes | No |
| Organization admin | Yes | Yes |

This assumes identity bootstrap or synchronization has written
`user:<sub> admin organization:<org>` for each platform administrator.

Do not grant `invoker`, `owner`, or another relation that implies `can_invoke`
on `mcp_server:scheduler` to a non-admin user or team if the intended policy is
strictly admin-only.

This caller check is independent of agent tool authorization. An admin must use
an agent whose `allowed_tools.scheduler` entries have been reconciled into the
agent-to-tool OpenFGA tuples. Conversely, a non-admin is denied at the scheduler
MCP server check even if the selected agent has scheduler tools.

For signed agent context and per-tool enforcement, configure the same HMAC
Secret for Dynamic Agents and the bridge:

```yaml
dynamic-agents:
  agentContext:
    existingSecret:
      name: caipe-agent-context
      key: CAIPE_AGENT_CONTEXT_HMAC_SECRET

openfga-authz-bridge:
  agentContext:
    existingSecret:
      name: caipe-agent-context
      key: CAIPE_AGENT_CONTEXT_HMAC_SECRET
```

## Operational behavior

- Schedule ownership is persisted in MongoDB. The owner supplied by an MCP tool
  argument or cron runner request is never trusted.
- Cron runner pods have no Kubernetes API token and no stored user bearer.
- Existing CronJobs are reconciled to the configured cron-runner image when the
  scheduler starts. The schedule version history records deployment-driven
  image updates.
- Kubernetes CronJob retry and concurrency settings are controlled by the
  scheduler-created job template, while BFF idempotency prevents a successful
  scheduled conversation from being created twice for the same run.
- If OpenFGA or the authorization bridge is unavailable, AgentGateway denies the
  restricted call rather than bypassing authorization.
